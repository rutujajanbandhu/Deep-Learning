# Deep-Learning
The lab work in this Deep Learning course is designed to provide hands-on experience with various deep learning techniques and architectures. Through practical assignments and projects, we gain a deeper understanding of the theoretical concepts covered in lectures, and develop the skills necessary to implement and experiment with state-of-the-art deep learning models.
